# Weather Station

You can see the web page here:

Thoughts:
  This has been done in spring 2022 and it was for web programming course. 		
  I became familiar with embedded systems through a project in which a system was created that measured weather data with sensors.
  This data was then transmitted through a network to a user interface, which you can see in the web page.
  I like how the page looks like but I could have commented better the code.
  Additionally, I could have named the web page title other than Document, which I seem to have forgotten to rename.
